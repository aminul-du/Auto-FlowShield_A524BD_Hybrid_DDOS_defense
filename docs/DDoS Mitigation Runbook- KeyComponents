I apologize, but I'm currently unable to access the Kentik Knowledge Base due to a temporary service issue. However, I can provide you with general guidance on DDoS mitigation runbooks based on industry best practices and Kentik's capabilities:

## DDoS Mitigation Runbook - Key Components

### 1. **Detection & Alert Response**
- Monitor Kentik alerts for DDoS attack indicators (TCP SYN floods, UDP floods, volumetric attacks)
- Verify alert legitimacy using Data Explorer to analyze traffic patterns
- Document baseline traffic metrics for comparison

### 2. **TCP SYN Flood Attack Runbook**

**Step 1: Detection**
- Alert triggers on abnormal TCP SYN packet rates
- Verify using Kentik's DDoS detection policies
- Check for SYN/ACK ratio imbalance

**Step 2: Analysis**
- Use Data Explorer to identify:
  - Source IPs and ASNs
  - Target destination IPs/ports
  - Attack volume (packets per second, bits per second)
  - Geographic distribution of attack sources

**Step 3: Mitigation**
- Implement SYN cookies on affected devices
- Apply rate limiting on upstream routers
- Deploy ACLs to block malicious source IPs/networks
- Engage with upstream ISP for traffic scrubbing if needed
- Consider BGP blackholing for severe attacks

**Step 4: Monitoring**
- Continuously monitor attack metrics
- Adjust mitigation strategies as attack evolves
- Document all actions taken

**Step 5: Recovery & Post-Incident**
- Gradually remove mitigation controls
- Verify normal service restoration
- Conduct post-mortem analysis
- Update runbooks based on lessons learned

### 3. **Essential Runbook Elements**

**Pre-Attack Preparation:**
- Contact lists (internal teams, ISPs, scrubbing services)
- Escalation procedures and thresholds
- Baseline traffic profiles
- Pre-configured mitigation templates

**During Attack:**
- Clear decision trees and action items
- Communication protocols (internal/external)
- Mitigation activation procedures
- Documentation requirements

**Post-Attack:**
- Service restoration checklist
- Incident report template
- Lessons learned review process
- Runbook update procedures

### 4. **Kentik-Specific Tools to Leverage**

- **Alerts**: Configure DDoS-specific alert policies
- **Data Explorer**: Real-time traffic analysis and filtering
- **Device Inventory**: Quick access to network topology
- **NMS Metrics**: Monitor device health during attacks

### 5. **Phase 7.2 - Runbook Development Best Practices**

- Document all common attack scenarios
- Include screenshots and CLI commands
- Define clear roles and responsibilities
- Establish testing and validation procedures
- Schedule regular runbook reviews and updates
- Incorporate feedback from actual incidents

## Recommended Next Steps

1. Please try accessing the Knowledge Base again later for official Kentik documentation
2. Review your current DDoS alert policies in the Kentik Portal
3. Test your runbooks with tabletop exercises
4. Ensure all team members have access to runbook documentation

Would you like me to help you analyze any current DDoS alerts or configure specific detection policies in Kentik?
