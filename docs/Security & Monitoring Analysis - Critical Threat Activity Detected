### ⚡ Immediate Actions Required

#### **Critical (Do Now)**
1. **Isolate Infected Hosts**
   - Quarantine IPs showing highest threat activity (listed above)
   - Block outbound connections to known sinkhole addresses
   - Investigate internal hosts communicating with threat IPs

2. **Block Malicious Traffic**
   - Implement firewall rules to block traffic to/from identified threat IPs
   - Consider geo-blocking if traffic patterns justify it
   - Enable IPS/IDS signatures for Andromeda, Ranbyus, and StealRat

3. **Incident Response**
   - Initiate malware scan on affected systems
   - Check for lateral movement within your network
   - Review authentication logs for compromised credentials

#### **High Priority (Next 24 Hours)**
1. **Forensic Analysis**
   - Capture full packet traces from infected hosts
   - Analyze malware samples if possible
   - Determine initial infection vector

2. **Network Segmentation**
   - Review and strengthen network segmentation
   - Implement micro-segmentation for critical assets
   - Restrict east-west traffic between segments

3. **Credential Reset**
   - Force password resets for potentially compromised accounts
   - Enable MFA where not already deployed
   - Review privileged account access

#### **Medium Priority (This Week)**
1. **Security Posture**
   - Update antivirus/EDR signatures
   - Patch vulnerable systems
   - Review and update security policies

2. **Monitoring Enhancement**
